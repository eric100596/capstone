    <h3>About This Game</h3>
    <p>
      This game is played like dominoes, but there is a twist! This deck has 36
      cards instead of the 28 that would be in a traditional dominoes game.
      Also, each card has an inspirational word on it from the Bible chosen
      specifically to remind players to remain positive while playing the game.
      The game was developed by Knowble, and is considered one of the best
      versions of game designed to bring generations of families together, while
      at the same time teaching foundational religious content.
