    <h3>About This Game</h3>
    <p>
      What do the words "Knowledge", "Temperance", "Respect", "Joy", "Prudence",
      "Honesty", "Vision", and "Liberty" have in common?
      <br />
      <br />
      They are all words that, when applied, will yield positive results. They
      are also all words you will find not only in the Bible, but on each of the
      cards in this game!
      <br />
      <br />
      This game is played like dominoes, but there is a twist! This deck has 36
      cards instead of the 28 that would be in a traditional dominoes game.
      Also, each card has an inspirational word on it from the Bible chosen
      specifically to remind players to remain positive while playing the game.
      The game was developed by Knowble, and is considered one of the best
      versions of game designed to bring generations of families together, while
      at the same time teaching foundational religious content.
